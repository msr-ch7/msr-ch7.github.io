Runs from 7:30 to 9AM.

Please stop by the Watson Center and join us for breakfast. We will have quick grab-and-go options for students who need to get to class and plenty of other breakfast options for adults. This is a great time to meet other MSR families and staff while we treat you to breakfast.
