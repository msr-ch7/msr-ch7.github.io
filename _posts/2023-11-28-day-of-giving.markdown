This is an important day at MSR where we come together as a school to raise money to support the campus and our students. Be on the lookout for exciting competitions, email updates, and creative ways to give to MSR. There is no dollar amount too small or too large. Every gift makes an immediate impact to our campus, our teachers, and most importantly, our students.
